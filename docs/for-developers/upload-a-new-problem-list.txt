# Uploading a New Problem List

This document describes the mechanism that lets users add a new problem list. It is
intended for developers.

## The Big Picture

The upload mechanism consists of three parts:

 - aimpl/_attachments/new.html — A basic upload form
 - aimpl/newlist — A document that has the uploaded tex file as an attachment
 - lib/cronjobs/process-new-list.rb — A glue script that turns the attachment into
   documents

The upload form page looks at the `/aimpl/newlist` document and checks the `is_new`
property. If true, a previous run of the upload occurred and the processing script
hasn't been run yet. If false, it will display an upload form.

The upload form adds the uploaded latex file to the `/aimpl/newlist` attachment list and sets the `is_new` property to true.

The processing script runs periodically and checks if the `/aimpl/newlist` `is_new` property is true. If it is, it reads the latex from the attachment, parses it using the `lib/*rb` parsers and inserts the result into CouchDB. It proceeds to delete the attachment and sets the `is_new` property to `false`.
